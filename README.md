# ViralBot Static Pages

This repository hosts the public pages required for the **ViralBot** TikTok integration:

- `index.html` – landing page with contact information.
- `privacy-policy.html` – privacy policy outlining data handling.
- `terms.html` – terms of service for users of the integration.

TikTok verification files are included to prove domain ownership.

## Development

Serve the site locally with Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.

All pages use simple semantic HTML and a shared stylesheet (`style.css`).
