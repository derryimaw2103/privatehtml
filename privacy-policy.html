        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our TikTok integration app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We request only the TikTok API permissions necessary for uploading and publishing videos on your behalf. No personal information is collected outside of what is required for these operations.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Data obtained through the TikTok API is used solely for actions you explicitly authorize, such as uploading videos. We do not share or sell your information to third parties.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Upload tokens and video metadata are cached only as long as needed to complete the upload. All temporary data is deleted within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2>User Controls</h2>
        <p>You may revoke access at any time through TikTok or request deletion of any residual data by emailing us.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>All communication occurs over HTTPS, and any temporary tokens are stored in encrypted form.</p>
